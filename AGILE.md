# Overview

Agile methodology was used throughout the deveploment for this project and I found it extremly helpful to keep track of my project and not get overwhelmed.  
The project was broken down into Epics and User Stories and the MoSCoW method was used to determine relevent features needed for the scope of this project.  
I implemented 10 day iterations so the the Epics and User Stories could be revised and re-prioritised once an iteration was complete.  
Issues were created in GitHub for each Epic and User Story with Tasks to complete and MoSCoW labels on each one. A Kanban board was also created to keep track of these Issues throughout each iteration. A Milestone for the MVP was also created and linked to relevant Issues.

# Epics and User Stories

I created a table detailing each User Story, which Epic it was related to along with Acceptance criteria, Tasks and Story Points. An Issue was then created on GitHub with this information.  
I would review these Epics and User Stories after each iteration and add or edit if necessary.  
I measured Story Points by 2 equalling a about a days work, these were very difficult to estimate and some took longer than my initial estimate and some were completed quicker, again I reviewed these after each iteration.  
User Story table can be seen below:

# Iterations and Kanban Board  

My working week is not always the same but I tried to stick to 10 day iterations allowing for 20 Story Points in each cycle.  
I allocated Issues to my Kanban board for each iteration. I then completed the MoSCow prioritisation for these issues. I made sure must have issues made up no more than 60%, could have and should have about 20% each.  
The project's Kanban board can be found [Here](https://github.com/users/DavidDock/projects/2)  
My paln was to do 5 iterations before the project deadline.  

## Iteration 1  

Start: 8/8/23
End: 17/9/23

Below is the Kanban board at the start of the iteration:  
![Iteration-One](/documentation/agile/iteration-one.png)  
The User Stories were added and prioritised as follows:

- User Story: Design Website Structure - Must Have. Story points: 4
- User Story: Design Choices - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Development Environment - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Deploy Site - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Base Template - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Site Admin - Should Have. Story points: 1
- User Story: Home Page - Should Have. Story Points: 2
- User Story: Initial Navigation Bar - Could Have. Story Points: 6  
  
Below is the Kanban board at the end of the iteration:

During this iteration I managed to complete all issues, I feel I over estimated the story points on some of the issues and I also managed to allocate more time to work on the project than expected.  
During this iteration I added Issues for a 'could have' Epic - A quiz feature and two 'should have' User Stories - error pages and a favicon.  

## Iteration 2  

Start: 18/9/23
End: 27/9/23

Below is the Kanban board at the start of the iteration:  
![Iteration-Two](/documentation/agile/iteration-two.png)  
The User Stories were added and prioritised as follows:

- User Story: Add Film Information - Must Have. Story points: 4
- User Story: View Films on About Page - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Film Detail Page - Must Have. Story points: 6
- User Story: Critic Comments - Should Have. Story points: 4
- User Story: Member Registration - Could Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Log In and Out - Could Have. Story Points: 2

Below is the Kanban board at the end of the iteration:  

![IterationTwo-End](/documentation/agile/iteration-two-end.png)  

During this iteration I did not managed to complete all the could have issues, I did not complete "Member Registration" and "Log In and Out". I took longer than expected on some of the issues this time around. In particular I struggled with a bug regarding cloudinary convig settings which took a long time to solve.  

## Iteration 3  

Start: 28/8/23
End: 7/10/23

Below is the Kanban board at the start of the iteration:  
![Iteration-Three](/documentation/agile/iteration-three.png)  
The User Stories were added and prioritised as follows:

- User Story: Member Registration - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Log In and Out - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: View Member Comments - Must Have. Story points: 4
- User Story: Member Area Page - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Member Can Add A Comment - Should Have. Story points: 4
- User Story: Member Can Edit Comments - Should Have. Story points: 4
- User Story: Member Can Delete Comments - Could Have. Story Points: 4

Below is the Kanban board at the end of the iteration:  

![Iteration-Three-End](/documentation/agile/iteration-three-end.png)  

During this iteration I completed all of the issues including the could haves. I took less time than expected on some of the issues this time around. I must admit I got a little ahead of myself and completed the user story "Favicon" before preparing the next iteration because it was such a quick task.

## Iteration 4  

Start: 8/10/23
End: 17/10/23

Below is the Kanban board at the start of the iteration:  
![Iteration-Four](/documentation/agile/iteration-four.png)  
The User Stories were added and prioritised as follows:

- User Story: Error Pages - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Rate Film By Category - Must Have. Story points: 4
- User Story: Ability To Delete Score - Must Have. Story points: 4
- User Story: View Average Scores - Must Have. Story points: 2
- User Story: Testing - Could Have. Story points: 10

Below is the Kanban board at the end of the iteration:  

![Iteration-Four-End](/documentation/agile/iteration-four-end.png)  

During this iteration I did not compelete the Testing user story so this is still in progress. Initial testing highlighted a number of issues that had to be fixed. In particular HTML testing showed that having multiple forms in the member area caused duplicate ID errors which caused me to re-think and implement a new layout of the member area.

## Iteration 5  

Start: 17/10/23
End: 27/10/23

Below is the Kanban board at the start of the iteration:  
![Iteration-Five](/documentation/agile/iteration-five.png)  
The User Stories were added and prioritised as follows:

- User Story: Testing - Must Have. Story points: 10
- User Story: Documentation - Must Have. Story points: 10  

These are the last two issues needed to complete the MVP milestone so both issues need to be competed before project submission.  

Below is the Kanban board at the end of the iteration:  

![Iteration-Five-End](/documentation/agile/iteration-five-end.png)  

The testing and documentation were completed in this iteration, to a good standard and in time for project end. There are some more [issues](https://github.com/DavidDock/works-of-wes-anderson/issues) that can be completed in future releases of the website. It would also be nice to implement automated testing on the project in the future.
