### Design

Wes Anderson is known for his unique visual style. He likes using symmetry, beautiful color pallets and huge attention to detail.  
This website is not trying to emulate Wes Anderson's style because that is not possible, but it does take elements of his design choices.  
Wes Anderson sticks with a clear design theme throughout his films and usualy has a retro feel to them. This website is the same and a simple retro newspaper design runs throughout with symmetrical layouts.
